# Misc Computational Neuroscience Projects & Labs  
by Nina Mizrahi  

## 👩‍💻 Overview  
I’m a computational neuroscience graduate (B.A. in Computational Neuroscience, Scripps College) with strong interests in machine learning, neural modelling, software engineering, and neurotech. This repository collects a selection of miscilanius comp neuro projects and labs that showcase how I apply data science, ML/AI, signal‑modelling, and programming skills to neuroscience‑inspired problems. 

### What you’ll find here  
- Notebook‑based tutorials and labs (e.g., generalized linear models for neural encoding, linear‑dynamical systems, Bayesian hidden‑state modelling)  
- Final‑project work leveraging computational modelling for neuroscience questions  
- Clean, well‑documented code using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, seaborn, numpy and relevant neuroscience/ML libraries  

## Highlighted Skills  
- **Machine Learning & Statistical Modelling** — I’ve applied GLMs, multiple‑linear regression, polynomial regression, Bayesian hidden‑state models, and linear‑dynamical systems to neuroscience‑relevant data (see the tutorial notebooks).  
- **Neural/Computational Neuroscience** — Projects include modelling encoding processes, computational modeling of neural systems, and exploring human‑AI learning dynamics.  
- **Software Engineering & Reproducibility** — Code is structured, clean, and documented; using best practices for notebooks and versioning (e.g., removing metadata widgets for GitHub compatibility).  
- **Data Analysis & Visualisation** — Extensive use of pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and jupyter workflows for data manipulation, analysis and efficient visual storytelling.  
- **Research Workflow Experience** — I’ve integrated these technical skills into broader research‑driven goals (e.g., modelling leaps of insight in humans and AIs, participatory VR interventions for dementia care) that build into meaningful outcomes.
